# Tips:

- UI and API tests to send password reset link to user's email and API tests to verify a password reset token and reset a user's password must be tested manually as they rely on e-mail verification. 
- K6 documentation is pleasant to the readers eyes. Have a look calmly.
- The github actions report will be generated for the last test file configured in the .yml file. 
- K6 doesn't recognize wrong header content "'Content-Type': 'badRequest'" as a bad request.
- It might be needed to increase credentials random length according to the test type.
